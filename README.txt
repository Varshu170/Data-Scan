This project is designed to help users extract text from scanned PDF files or images and convert it into searchable and editable documents. The main objective is to make the text within these scanned documents easily searchable and editable, providing convenience and flexibility to users. You have the freedom to choose the output format that best suits your needs, whether it's PDF, Word, or plain text.

Let's say you upload a scanned PDF file or an image. This project utilizes the power of py-tesseract, a text recognition tool, to identify the text within the document. Depending on your preference, the extracted text can then be converted into a searchable document format.

If you opt for a PDF output, we generate a new PDF document that incorporates the extracted text. This allows you to effortlessly search for specific words or phrases within the document using any PDF reader of your choice. On the other hand, if you prefer a Word document, we create a new editable file where you can modify the content, apply formatting, and make further changes as needed. Alternatively, if you desire a plain text document, we provide a simple text file containing the extracted text. This format is particularly useful if you want to process the text programmatically or have a basic, editable version of the document at hand.

Our project aims to deliver a user-friendly solution that transforms your original scanned document or image into a searchable, editable, and easily accessible format by effectively extracting and converting the text.

The Output path is given by the user with the file extension (note: without quotes "")
